 #Pomodoro Timer 
It's a timer created to help users keep track of time 
when they are following the pomodoro method of working. 

##What is Pomodoro Method
>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros. After about four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15 to 20 minutes.
